# Lovecoin
lovecoin is a project by NPTNNE and Relative Convergence to give back to the community as well as to make the music experience more immersive. According to Abraham Maslow human realization is bound by ones ability to freely and safely express themselves; so by consuming smomething that you enjoy and having the shared expeince of live music you are making the world a better place; which we believe you should be rewarded for. Lovecoin as of now will only exist on github as we are just starting out but as we scale up we will eventually publicly list the crypto currency. Our goal is to have participation in the music experience be an act equivalent to "traditional" mining - just as a plant scrubs carbon dioxide from the atmosphere it is rewarded with the compound crucial to its growth process. People who are in attanadance or have a receipt from merchandise will be able to claim a certain amount of lovecoin when it goes public.
